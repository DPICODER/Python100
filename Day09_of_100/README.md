# Silent Auction Bidder

## Introduction
Welcome to the Silent Auction Bidder! This program allows participants to enter their names and bid amounts for a silent auction. The winner is determined based on the highest bid. The auction will continue until all participants have placed their bids.

### Getting Started
To participate in the silent auction, run the provided Python script. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter your name and bid amount. You can continue entering bids or choose to finish the auction.

```python
python Auction_bidder.py
```

### How It Works
1. Enter your name and bid amount when prompted.
2. Decide whether there are any other bidders ('y' for yes, 'n' for no).
3. If there are more bidders, the program will clear the screen, and you can enter the next bid.
4. If there are no more bidders, the program will determine the winner based on the highest bid and display the result.

### Functions
- `bidder_pro(bidding_record)`: Determines the winner and highest bid from the bidding record.

### Winning Bid
After all participants have placed their bids, the program will announce the winner and display the highest bid.
